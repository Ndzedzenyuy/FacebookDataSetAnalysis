# FacebookDataSetAnalysis
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Facebook dataset to uncover insights about user behavior, engagement, and popularity. The purpose of this analysis is to help Facebook identify users who are more valuable to the platform so that they can be targeted with the right features and recommendations. 

From the analysis, we discovered that youths are the most active and engaged on Facebook, with higher friend counts and stronger interactions. We also found that women tend to have more friends than men, making them slightly more “popular” in terms of friend count. Additionally, we examined how males and females behave differently in their activity and engagement levels. Using network analysis, we identified key influencers—users with high centrality who act as hubs in the network and can drive interactions across communities.

These insights provide useful direction for business decision-making. By understanding which groups of users are more engaged, more popular, or more influential, Facebook can tailor strategies to increase retention and engagement. This analysis also lays the groundwork for future studies, such as predictive modeling to classify high-value users or building recommendation systems to better serve the platform’s most active members.

We also used Gephi, which is a software used for visualization to create visuals that were more interactive.
